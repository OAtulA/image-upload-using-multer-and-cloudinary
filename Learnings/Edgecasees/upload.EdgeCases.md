# upload Edge cases

## More than max limit files uploaded

So I thought lets handle this on backend.  
Although a validation can be added on the frontend.  
But I do not want my server to stop just because of a validation.

So I added it here in the code and everything works despite
more than max limit files uploaded. My server will send a polite message.  
This saves us in the production
